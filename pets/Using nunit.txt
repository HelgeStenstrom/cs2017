How I use nunit:

csc petTests.cs Pets.cs -reference:/Users/helge/Downloads/NUnit.Framework-3.8.0/bin/net-4.5/nunit.framework.dll 

mono /Users/helge/Downloads/NUnit.Framework-3.8.0/bin/net-4.5/nunitlite-runner.exe petTests.exe



The nunit installation could be moved to a more convenient place.
There is an nunit in the mono installation too, but it's deprecated and doesn't seem to work.
